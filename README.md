# Kevin H. Wong, PhD

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Miami Rosentiel School for Atmospheric, Marine, and Earth Sciences in the Cnidarian Immunity Lab. My research uses physiological and molecular approaches to understand the impacts of climate change on marine invertebrates. 

In my repository, have have pipelines and examples for the following analyses:

### Physiology
* Respirometry
* Total Protein
* Total Carbohydrate
* Cholorophyll
* Color Score
* Endosymbiont Cell Density

### Metabolomics
* Pre-data Processing
* PLSDA and VIP selection
* WCNA (Weighted Correlational Network Analysis)
* Enrichment Analysis with MetaboAnalyst

### Amplicon Sequencing
* ITS2 amplicon sequencing (Symbiondinaceae identification)
* 16s rRNA amplicon seqeuncing (Bacterial identification)

### Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing
* Pre-data processing and methylation calling
* Genome Feature Analysis
* Differentially Methylated Genes (DMGs)
* WGCNA (Weighted Correlational Gene Network Analysis)

### Genome annotations
* Structural Genome Annotation
* Functional Genome Annotation

### Tagseq
* Pre-data processing 
* Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs)
* WGCNA (Weighted Correlational Gene Network Analysis)

### Single-cell RNAseq
* Cell Ranger (Data QC and Alignment to the genome)
* Seurat (Visualization and cell cluster markers)
