# Kevin H. Wong, PhD

## About me 
I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School for Atmospheric, Marine, and Earth Sciences in the [Cnidarian Immunity Lab](https://www.cnidimmunitylab.com/) with Dr. Nikki Traylor-Knowles. I completed my PhD in Biological and Environmental Sciences at the University of Rhode Island with [Dr. Hollie Putnam](https://putnamlab.com/). My research uses a suite of physiological and molecular approaches to understand the impacts of climate change on marine invertebrates. 

View my CV, Google Scholar page, and other links on my [website](https://sites.google.com/view/kevin-h-wong/home/). I use [open lab notebooks](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/) and GitHub to make data and code openly accessible.
